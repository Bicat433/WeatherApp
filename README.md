Project Report: Weather Forecast System in JavaIntroduction:
The Weather Forecast Application is a Java-based console program designed to provide
users with real-time weather information for a specified city. The application integrates
with an external weather API to fetch and display weather data to users. The project is
organized into several classes, each serving a specific purpose in achieving the overall
functionality.
2. Components and Functionality:
2.1 WeatherApp Class:
The WeatherApp class serves as the entry point for the application. It includes a main menu loop
where users can choose between obtaining weather information for a specific city or exiting the
application. The class handles user input, interacts with the WeatherService to retrieve weather
data, and displays relevant information to the user.
2.2 WeatherService Class:
The WeatherService class is responsible for interacting with an external weather API. It uses the
HttpURLConnection class to make an HTTP request to the API endpoint. The API key is included
in the request headers for authentication. The class also utilizes the JSONParser from the
org.json.simple library to parse the JSON response from the API. The extracted data is used to
create a Weather object.
2.3 Weather Class:
The Weather class represents the weather information for a specific location. It encapsulates
attributes such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud percentage. The class provides
getter and setter methods for each attribute, and the toString method is overridden to offer a
meaningful string representation of a Weather object.
3. User Interaction:
The application uses the Scanner class to take user input for menu options and city names. The
main menu provides a clear and straightforward interface for users to choose between obtaining
weather information or exiting the application. The program handles invalid inputs gracefully,
prompting users to try again.
4. API Interaction:
The WeatherService class interacts with an external API (https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/weather)
to retrieve weather information. The API key is securely included in the request headers, and the
program includes retry logic in case of a failure to fetch data from the API.
5. Code Structure and Readability:
The code is well-organized and follows Java conventions. It uses meaningful variable and method
names, enhancing code readability. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles,
encapsulation, and exception handling. However, the API key is hardcoded, which is a potential
security concern in a production environment.
6. Conclusion:
The Weather Forecast Application is a functional and user-friendly program that provides a
practical example of integrating external APIs in a Java application. The modular structure of the
code facilitates maintenance and further development. To enhance security, it is recommended to
implement a secure method for handling API keys, such as using environment variables or a
configuration file.
7. Future Improvements:
Future enhancements to the project could include:
• Implementing a more robust user interface, possibly through a graphical interface.
• Adding support for multiple weather providers to offer users choices.
• Incorporating unit tests to ensure the reliability of the application.
• Enhancing error handling and providing more detailed error messages to users.
In conclusion, the Weather Forecast Application successfully achieves its goal of providing users
with quick and accessible weather information through a well-designed and functional Java
program
